# Eastern Hemisphere Town Hall

## **BACKDROP**

Acts as the reference for the current and future iterations on the method to create future TH based on regional preference.

### **Who?**

1. Community Members _\(sequence based on alphabetic order\)_ :
   1. Miyatake Toshiaki & Yuta – Japan
   2. Phil Lewis & Greg Bell – Australia
   3. Tim O’Brien – Vietnam
   4. Yan Tirta – Indonesia
   5. Felix Weber – Swarm
2. Operational Roles _\(sequence based on alphabetic order\)_ :
   1. Phil Lewis – Moderator
   2. Tim O’Brien & Greg Bell –
   3. Yan Tirta – Documentation and content creator
   4. Felix Weber – Networker

### **What?**

1. Create a Town Hall that caters to the Eastern Hemisphere
2. Create breakout rooms for the Eastern Hemisphere that functions as FDG for topics chosen by the community _\(mimicking the working formula of Catalyst Swarm\)_

### **Why?**

1. Urge of the Eastern Hemisphere to have a break-out session in their time zone
2. Growing interest of Project Catalyst most particularly it’s funding series in the Eastern Hemisphere
3. 50% of all staked ADA is held by a disconnected Japan ADA community 

### **When?**

1. After establishing a strong local community with or
2. After formulating a universally agreed upon Eastern Hemisphere Town Hall _\(ETH\)_ format dan it’s development phases 

### **Where?**

1. Zoom sessions every Saturday at 10AM UTC
2. Catalyst Swarm Discord channel under the topic Easter Hemisphere sub-topic Hemisphere Discussion
3. Local communities Discord channel
4. Zoom sessions following TH only after ETH has a universally agreed upon format 

### **How?** _**\(Method A \| Starting Small\)**_

1. Consolidating potential interest of respective existing local communities by leveraging the allure of the Project Catalyst fund series
2. Create a unified communication channel which can take shape in the form of :
   1. firstly a Telegram channel _\(and in parallel an Instagram channel\)_
   2. followed by a Discord channel
   3. finally utilizing Miro
3. This unified communication channel is initially moderated for the creation of a unified proposal to participate in Project Catalyst fund series
4. Topics outside Project Catalyst fund series should be left to the local community members to decide/develop on naturally
5. ETH functions as the opportunity for local communities to interact with Town Hall/ETH members on topics covered by the Town Hall that previous day
6. ETH breakout rooms functions as the opportunity for local communities to have FDG for topics chosen by the community one week prior each ETH that is determined in the various communications channels

### **How?** _**\(Method B \| Educating through Potential Problem Solving\)**_

1. Providing marketing materials that describes blockchain in a simple and easy to understand manner
2. Providing marketing materials continues from point \(a\) into explaining the Cardano blockchain in a simple and easy to understand manner
3. Providing marketing materials that displays examples of Cardano blockchain use case that specifically caters to each ETH region as a method to entice brainstorming between the local communities
4. Providing marketing materials that explain Project Catalyst funding series as a potential financial source for local communities to materialize ideas that come from that brainstorming moment
5. These marketing materials are provided as links for the local community to access at anytime and are provided on :
   1. the YouTube channel
   2. pinned on the Telegram channel
   3. made a topic channel on Discord
6. Examples of Cardano blockchain use case that specially caters to each ETH region will be a staple session of live ETH
7. Examples of Cardano blockchain use for the live ETH will be determined by voting session in the various communications channels a day after that weeks live ETH
8. **How?** _**\(Minute-by-minute Zoom session timestamps sequencing/ETH 1.0\)**_

* 03:00 - **ETH tradition** \| Welcome greeting by appointee
* 05:00 - **TH Quickie** \| Recap for those you did not have chance to view TH yet
* 10:00 - **TH Quickie Q&A** \| Addressing any questions related to the TH
* 15:00 - **Presentation Session** \| By proposers seeking support form ETH
* 30:00 - **ETH Problem Solving Example 1** \| Based on country
* 40:00 - **ETH Problem Solving Example 2** \| Based on issue
* 50:00 - Community hot discussion topic\(s\) or call for assistance
* 55:00 - Call to get involved in discussions or to assist
* 56:30 - ETH various community channels
* 58:30 - Break-out topic list and most requested
* 60:00 - Break-out sessions based on most requested topics

1. **How?** _**\(Minute-by-minute Zoom session supporting\)**_
   1. providing live translation
   2. providing sub-titles post live ETH
   3. providing timestamps
   4. providing various links to ETH and Catalyst channels
   5. providing various links to marketing materials
   6. providing various links to hot discussion topic\(s\) or call for assistance

## **VALUE PROPOSITION**

ETH seeks to provide a TH that echoes the very first TH but experiments on it’s focus of discussion on the possible problem solving side of the Cardano blockchain.

### **Predictions**

1. increased participation in proposing proposals in Project Catalyst since many Eastern Hemisphere countries are accustomed to the start-up culture
2. increased interest in Cardano blockchain in general
3. do not expect increase participation on the technical side of Project Catalyst such as in the form of CA, vCA and the caveats surrounding them

### **VISUALIZING DEVELOPMENT PHASES**

Acts as a visual reference of the initial development phases of the ETH. Development phases are open to critique and contribution.

### **LOOP AND COMPOUNDING EFFECT**

Utilizing the teachings and working formula from the TH and Catalyst Swarm, ETH seeks to provide a more pragmatic adoptive approach towards Cardano through focusing on encouraging solutions adopting Cardano. Which we believe will further enhance and add dimension to the development of the TH protocol.

In the spirit of :

“One parts Discoveries become the other parts Discoveries, one parts Failures becomes as well the other parts Discoveries.”

### **PROTOCOL**

This project will be documented with the goal to create an outcoming protocol that can be used to onboard and introduce other communities into the Catalyst Ecosystem. This project is a very first community bridge-building prototype and will iterate and increase over time by practice.

The practice advantages lies in a highly dynamic and flexible mechanism, which is always able to experiment, adjust and grow by practice. The protocol and eventual solutions will be created by a “practice-first” approach. Create theory out of practice-proven mechanisms from the bottom up.
